=======================
Project Generation
=======================

To generate a project using fastapp, then run the command-line utility.

.. code:: bash

    fastapp

This uses `https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/` cookiecutter to generate a project for you.

This will use the template that comes with your fastapp installation. If you wish to use the most up-to-date template, then run

.. code:: bash

    fastapp gh

This will use the template from the fastapp-cookiecutter repository on Github. If you wish to create your own template, feel free to fork that repository and use the new URL as the command-line argument.
